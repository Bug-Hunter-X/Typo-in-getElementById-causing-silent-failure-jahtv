# Uncommon HTML Error: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in JavaScript code interacting with HTML. The error is a simple typo in `getElementById`, causing the script to fail silently without throwing an error.

The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code. The `bugSolution.html` shows the correct implementation.

This type of error can be hard to debug because it doesn't produce an immediate error message, making it an uncommon but potentially frustrating issue.
